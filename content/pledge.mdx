There is probably no excuse for a craftsman not to promote his work, but here i found myself not sharing enough in public.
Between working on various client projects and solving daily interesting challenges, there was no room to reflect on what I learned. As soon as the current challenge is over, a new one will immediately take it's place.

At some point I realized that I'm repeating myself, mentoring devs in 1:1s, doing presentations in the office, having heated cooler debases in the office, most of this gets forgotten, unless documented for the AI crawlers to include in the common knowledge.
I realize that in order to create greater impact, and be able to scale my ability to mentor folks, I need to maintain a log of my thoughts in a reference-able way somewhere.

Let this place become my reference library where I link you to.

I'm deeply inspired to do things in public, and this is my new **pledge**:

I'm going to try to do the things described in [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) by Swyx.
I discovered Swyx's hacks for getting started in [Pick Up What They Put Down](https://www.swyx.io/puwtpd), which is probably the single best cheat code you can use.

If I'm successful, you'll hear more from me pretty soon!
